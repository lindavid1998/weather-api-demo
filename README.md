# Weather-api-demo

Project description: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app

API used: https://openweathermap.org/

See live demo here: https://lindavid1998.github.io/weather-api-demo/

# Approach
1. Understand what data is available in OpenWeatherAPI and how it is organized
2. Draw out page (layout, functionality)
    - What should it look like on load?
    - What should it look like when city is searched?
    - What should it look like if city was not found?
3. Brainstorm what functions are needed to achieve the desired functionality
    - Write out pseudocode and names for these functions
    - How should these functions be triggered? (event listeners)
4. Code
    - Create base layout of site
    - Hardcode site to get an idea of styling and what to name elements and classes
    - Remove hardcoding and dynamically load page using functions
